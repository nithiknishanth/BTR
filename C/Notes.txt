Today I am gonna start my Back_To_Roots process, where I relearn all coding/programming concepts from scratch.
And this is going to be my main Notes Page/Journal as I go through this journey.
After much taught I belive I am going to learn C programming as my base and gonna extend it to Java.
As all other languages are going to be a derivative the the above or too slow like python.
And this time around I am going to learn in-depth concepts and completely understand the very fundamentals of,
computer science.

Day 1:
Variables:
char : Smallest addressable unit of the machine that contains a basic character.
signed char : of the same size as char, but guarented to be signed.
unsigned char : of the same size as char, but guarented to be unsigned.
short : short signed integer
int : basic signed integer
unsigned : basic unsigned integer
long : long signed integer type
unsigned long : long unsigned integer type
long long : long signed integer
unsigned long long : long unsigned integer
float : Real floating point type
double : Real floating point type
long double : Real floating point type  


format specifiers:
%c = character
%s = string
%f = float
%lf = double
%d = integer
%.1 = decimal; precision
%1 = minimim field width
%- = left align


Day 2:
Some of the common string functions are
strlwr -> converts a string to lowercase
strupr -> converts a string to uppercase
strcat -> appends string2 to end of string1
strcpy -> copy string2 to string1
strncpy -> copy n characters of string2 to string1

continue = skips rest of code and forces the next iteration of the loop
break = exits a loop/switch


bitwise operators
& and operators
| or operators
^ Xor
<< left shift
>> right shift


Day 3:
checkout Graphviz for representing graphs in C
To use dot framework to visualize graphs use the below command 
$ dot example.dot -Tpdf > graph.pdf
and check out graph.pdf generated
